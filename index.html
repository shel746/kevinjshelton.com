          <h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! My name is Kevin Shelton. I am a senior software engineer at StockX for the Growth Experience Team. I've worked here for 4 years and been an integral part of the evolution of the team and products. Some projects I've designed and taken the lead of a group of engineers includes: creating returns for StockX, creating a new notification platform, creating a new messaging channel, improving notification delivery rate, and creating our first product as a notification - Gift Cards!  <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, I worked at Amazon for 4 years. The first 2 I worked on a data pipeline team that handles and distributes all clickstream and security data. One of these pipeline handles 20 PB/day and another handles 6 million TPS. The next 2, I worked on the clickstream team which used hadoop jobs to create sessions for each user out of that data. I worked on and led numerous projects that included cost savings, a new data pipeline, and a new system that enables cached data to be included in clickstream data. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a strong passion for backend engineering and building resiliant systems for customers. I love helping other engineers and the company bring value to customers via creating new products, re-engineering old ones, or simply fixing nasty bugs that have been around for a while. I've been luck enough to do this since my senior year in college where I worked as a Course Producer for CSCI 310, Software Engineering all the way to today at StockX. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other passions include playing and watching sports (Go Warriors, Giants, and 49ers!) and exercising. I also enjoy traveling the world either by myself or with friends and family. In the Places I've Been section, I provide a <a href="#worldmap">map</a> with all the places I have been or plan to go!</h4>
